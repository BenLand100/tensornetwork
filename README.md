# TensorNetwork

This is a python/numpy implementation of standard neural network techniques.
The `tensornetwork` module contains:

* Sigmoid, Tanh, and (leaky) ReLU activation functions
* Dense, convolutional, and many simpler networks structures
* Pointwise tensor operations for implementing residual networks
* Forward/back propagation algorithms for managing arbitrary networks

See the Jupyter notebooks for usage examples.
